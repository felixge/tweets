$ man 7 vdso

One  frequently  used system call is gettimeofday(2).  This system call is called both directly by user-space applications as well
as indirectly by the C library.  Think timestamps or timing loops or polling—all of these frequently need to know what time it  is
right now.  This information is also not secret—any application in any privilege mode (root or any unprivileged user) will get the
same answer.  Thus the kernel arranges for the information required to answer this question to be placed in memory the process can
access.  Now a call to gettimeofday(2) changes from a system call to a normal function call and a few memory accesses.
